A majority of the CS Data Pipelines were created using some version of SQLAlchemy-Core.

SQLAlchemy-Core can be used to execute raw SQL queries after creating the engine (https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/engines.html). The SQLAlchemy Engine has basic methods such as .connect(), .execute(), .dispose()

Generic structure is as follows (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43300886/what-is-the-difference-between-sqlalchemy-core-and-orm):

engine = create_engine('mysql://scott:tiger@localhost/test')
connection = engine.connect()
result = connection.execute("select username from users")
for row in result:
    print("username:", row['username'])
connection.close()
